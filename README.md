# Botcheck
### Botcheck exists to help the user know when an item is back in stock.
It notifies the user via a text, and can also notify when issues are found. It will complete a daily update at 6 pm CST to verify everything is working and the code isn't hung up. Default is 10 min recheck and tmobile as carrier.
